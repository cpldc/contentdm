JAWS review notes:
    alt text
    background content 
        dont see any of that
    ascii art
        dependent on bibliocommons
        can make some changes now, via css, no graphical changes
    h1, h2, h3, h4, h5
        ug
            need to clean up when I do use it, and implement it where I don't
    landmarks (main, article, etc)
        should be ok, I use main correctly, and I don't rely have articles; 
        section is used inconsistently, does that matter?
    aria label navigation labels
        not sure how to implement?
        whatever it ends up being, it should be consistent with bibliocommons
    ul/li
        I don't think I do this 
        maybe my lists should be nested?
    form field labels
        maybe get some explanation on this one, or maybe I'll be lucky and not have to care
        probably get away with just "search digital collections"
    iframes
        nope
    tables
        events? those are divs tho

    use dsplay: none instead of positioning things offscreen...

    sequences 
        shouldnt be a problem for me
        cards are rendered the way cards are rendered, tough luck there 
    color contrast ratios
        that "view more" blue is a problem  
            the darker version, used in some mouseovers, is ok
            is it ok if the hover contrast is inadequate?
                no.
    font sizing
        seems like a responsive issue - 
        fixed sizes enlarge just fine, but if you have to horizontally sroll to read, that's a responsiveness problem, not a font size problem
    keyboard navigation
        none of my js-built header stuff is keyboard usable
            search
            browse
            events
        bibliocommons "skip to main navigation" in responsive is broken
            should I replicate those?
