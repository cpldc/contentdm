JAWS review notes:
    alt text
        WIP
    background content 
        dont see any of that
//    ascii art
//        dependent on bibliocommons
//        can make some changes now, via css, no graphical changes
//    h1, h2, h3, h4, h5
//        ug
//            need to clean up when I do use it, and implement it where I don't
    landmarks (main, article, etc)
        should be ok, I use main correctly, and I don't really have articles; 
        section is used inconsistently, can probably clean that up
    aria label navigation labels
        not sure how to implement?
        whatever it ends up being, it should be consistent with bibliocommons
    ul/li
        maybe sidebar lists should be nested?
            sidebar: ul>li>Browse By...>ul>li^^Browse by... etc
    form field labels
        get some explanation on this one
        probably get away with just "search digital collections"
            PER GP: do it like p 26
    iframes
        nope
    tables
        events? those are divs tho
    sequences 
        check with f12
    color contrast ratios
        dependent on bibliocommons
            wait?  switch blues now?
            PER GP: get rid of all light blues
    widen everything to match bibliocommons
    font sizing
        seems like a responsive issue - fixed sizes enlarge just fine, but if you have to horizontally scroll to read, that's a responsiveness problem, not a font size problem
    keyboard navigation
        js-built header stuff is keyboard unusable
            search
            browse
            events
        bibliocommons "skip to main navigation" in responsive is broken
            gotta replicate these 
        in page links work? notoriously don't
    focus order
        seems ok
    link purpose
        "view more" in the blogs/events
            PER GP: use aria tag for these
    mouseover should not be pointer on "search te digital collections"
    pg 51, example 2: they want images with alt text instead of <i> - but this disables font imagery, which is the future -
        instead, per fontawesome, use aria-labels on the <a> around it, like: 
            <a href="path/to/shopping/cart" aria-label="View 3 items in your shopping cart">
                <i class="fa fa-shopping-cart" aria-hidden="true"></i>
            </a>
    parsing
        /incorrect nesting:
            should looki for this
                (minor issue, because my html is probably perfect)
        /duplicate id elements?
        html checker: http://validator.w3.org/nu/

> Remove the role="menuitemradio"and associated aria-checked attribute from each option
    bibliocommons has so much js hanging on stuff like this, they're dug in

    buttons used as links/vice versa
