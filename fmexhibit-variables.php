I was astonished and amazed when I first saw them. I'm impressed with their beauty, durability and design. The ones that I find most impressive are the Oriental Institute, and the Museum of Science and Industry.","The Oriental Institute has a special section for the ancient history of Sudan, with historical archaeological monuments of ancient Egyptian Pharaohs and Black Pharaohs of the old Sudanese kingdoms. These are from the historic homelands of my own tribe, the Mararit. When I first saw these monuments of our ancestors in the museum, a wonderful feeling came over me: I was in my home country. I felt a sense of peace knowing that this country where I took refuge—the United States—is the country where my spirit had lived long before I arrived here. I felt that I wouldn’t be alienated in this country as long as the history of my homeland is contained in its museums. ","The Museum of Science and Industry means a lot to me too. I come from a society where traditional tools are still used in agricultural and industrial activities. The majority of my former community members did not receive a basic or secondary education. Although Sudanese institutions of higher education teach the fundamentals of science, arts, industry and technology, there are no museums like the Museum of Science and Industry, only visiting exhibitions. Ruling regimes have not valued these kinds of places. I took this picture of the museum as an expression of my admiration and fascination. It affirms my hope that Sudan will someday build a similar place and see why it’s important. The design of this museum also reminds me of the temples of our ancestors, the Black Pharaohs, and of our mosques. This makes me more enthusiastic about integrating into American society and all of its diversity. My decision to seek refuge in the US and to live here forever is the soundest decision I've ever made. The US will remain my homeland, dear to my heart."];
