                        On January 1, 1873, Chicago Public Library opened its doors in a <a href="http://cdm16818.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/search/collection/woop/searchterm/Water+tank/field/subjed/mode/all/conn/and/order/nosort">circular water tank</a> at the southeast corner of LaSalle and Adams streets that had survived the Great Chicago Fire of 1871. These photographs trace our history from that small structure to a system of 80 locations across the city.
