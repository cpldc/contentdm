I felt a sense of peace knowing that this country where I took refuge\u2014the United States\u2014is the country where my spirit had lived long before I arrived here. I felt that I wouldn\u2019t be alienated in this country as long as the history of my homeland is contained in its museums.\u00a0",

The majority of my former community members did not receive a basic or secondary education. Although Sudanese institutions of higher education teach the fundamentals of science, arts, industry and technology, there are no museums like the Museum of Science and Industry, only visiting exhibitions. Ruling regimes have not valued these kinds of places. I took this picture of the museum as an expression of my admiration and fascination. It affirms my hope that Sudan will someday build a similar place and see why it\u2019s important. The design of this museum also reminds me of the temples of our ancestors, the Black Pharaohs, and of our mosques. This makes me more enthusiastic about integrating into American society and all of its diversity. My decision to seek refuge in the US and to live here forever is the soundest decision I've ever made. The US will remain my homeland, dear to my heart."
